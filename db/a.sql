Everything was in line with the best practices of project management: the project was initiated, the project requirements were collected, stakeholders were identified, and I started looking for a vendor. In the process of market research, the project team received 7 proposals from agencies in Toronto. Of these, we chose the vendor that was most suitable in terms of value for money. During the discovery session with the vendor, corrections were made to the project plan and the work has begun. I supported the project team with planning, coordination, and reporting, as well as facilitated project meetings, prepared agendas, presentations, and meeting minutes. I effectively escalated early warning signs and deviations from the plan to the senior management (CEO + VP of Operations).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in the course of the project the vendor failed to deliver against the SOW. The design phase was completed by the vendor with a significant delay. And after the prototypes were evaluated by their development team, the vendor refused to further cooperate with the project team and terminated the contract.</p>\n\n<p>The team has also learned, that with tens of thousands of potential product records, a high volume of product complexity and dozens of product attributes as well as the complexity of the search and product display requirements, utilizing WordPress, Magento or WooCommerce as an integrated solution will NOT provide the required functionality or be future proof for additional growth of the Zaneen digital roadmap.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, I took the initiative to complete the project on my own. And <b>from late October 2019 I was solely responsible for the programming of the web portal</b>. I have converted UI prototypes from Invision to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery. The custom platform and the back-end functionality was built from scratch in PHP OOP. A number of publicly available libraries (classes) and Composer were also used. I also did the work of designing and maintainig the database (MySQL). Prepared the production server (Linux Ubuntu) and then administered it.</p>\n\n<p>Zaneen currently utilizes Oracle NetSuite for its accounting, product data and business management functions. This is a cloud system maintained by Oracle. One of the most important requirements was integration of the Zaneen product data with the new web portal. A schedule and automated procedure to refresh web server product data was created to allow this option.</p>\n\n<p>The beta version of the public part of the portal was <b>completed by the end of February 2020</b>. After that, in March there were several reviews with the key project stakeholders, including customer representatives to test the usability of the portal and make the final list of small outstanding tasks. </p>\n\n\n		</div>\n\n	</div>\n\n</div>\n\n', 'ca', 'zaneen-web-portal', 'project-zaneen-new-website.jpg', 'project-zaneen-new-website-cover.jpg');
